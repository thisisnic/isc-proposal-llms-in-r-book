# The proposal

## Overview

The proposal is to write a free online book about LLMs in R. It will address the problem by providing a centralised location where people can find resources to help learn about the topic. The benefits to the R community is the ability to quickly upskill in an area which is moving quickly and is broad in nature.

The book will prioritise making concepts accessible to readers by employing educational tactics such as using laddering to build complex ideas one piece at a time, avoiding jargon and carefully defining it where it is necessary, as well as using metaphors to break ideas down. The focus would be on avoiding unnecessary complexity while also equipping the reader with the relevant information to learn independently.

The book would take a problem-oriented approach, starting from the kinds of problems R users face when working with LLMs, and then discussing resources and solutions. It will follow the [diataxis documentation framework's definition of "explanation"](https://diataxis.fr/explanation/) rather than "tutorial", "how-to", or "reference", and so avoid duplicating existing resources.

It will include discussion of the ethics, for example, debates around model generation, environmental impact, and how to structure work to reduce cost and environmental impact.

This kind of resource is unlikely to be created via the traditional means of publishing a physical book, due to the speed of change in the LLMs/AI space at the moment.  Creating this as an online resource means that there is scope to quickly update content, as new technologies and ideas emerge.

## Detail

### Social Infrastructure

This project is an investment in the R community's ability to engage with AI and LLM technologies. Like past ISC-funded work on translation, education, and documentation, it will create shared knowledge that lowers barriers to participation. Beyond producing a book, the project will set up reusable infrastructure: clear contribution processes, an editorial model, and a plan for long-term maintenance. By pulling together scattered expertise into a single, community-owned resource, it will strengthen R's role in the AI/LLM landscape while providing governance and contribution patterns other projects can adapt.

### Minimum Viable Product

A functional MVP will include:
- 3-4 complete foundational chapters providing immediate value to R users
- Working Quarto book infrastructure with CI/CD
- Community contribution guidelines and templates
- Live website accessible to the R community

Initial planning and repository structure has already been created at https://github.com/thisisnic/llms-in-r to support rapid MVP development.

### Architecture

The project will be stored in a public repository on GitHub, using Quarto to create the book, and GitHub Actions to render it. This technical infrastructure will include:

- Reusable CI/CD pipeline for community-maintained documentation projects including  Reusable GitHub Actions workflows for Quarto-based R community books, including automated testing, accessibility validation, readability score and spellchecks
- Standardised contribution templates and review processes
- Content freshness monitoring system - Automated CI/CD jobs that flag potentially outdated content based on package version changes, broken links, and time-based triggers
- Editorial workflow infrastructure that can be adapted by other R community resources
- Automated content validation and consistency checking systems

### Community Infrastructure Deliverables

Beyond the book content, this project will deliver reusable community infrastructure:
- Editorial board governance model and processes
- Contribution guidelines and templates for collaborative technical documentation that other R community projects can adopt for similar documentation efforts
- Automated publishing and maintenance workflows
- Community engagement and feedback collection systems

### Assumptions

One assumption is that changes in applications of LLMs won't change so rapidly that the book would need to be entirely rewritten in the near future.  This risk is mitigated in part by keeping content focused on context and explanation over how-to guidance (which already exist). For example, while available underlying models and their capabilities are likely to see many changes over time, deciding factors for choosing an appropriate model will see less change.

### External dependencies

The project relies on GitHub Actions for automated builds and on existing R packages that provide LLM functionality.
