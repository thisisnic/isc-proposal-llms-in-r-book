# The proposal

## Overview

My proposal is to write a free online book on LLMs in R. It will address the problem by providing a centralised location where people can find resources to help learn about the topic. The benefits to the R community is the ability to quickly upskill in an area which is moving quickly and is broad in nature.

The book will prioritise making concepts accessible to readers by employing educational tactics such as using laddering to build complex ideas one piece at a time, avoiding jargon and carefully defining it where it is necessary, as well as using metaphors to break ideas down. The focus would be on avoiding unnecessary complexity while also equipping the reader with the relevant information to learn independently.

The book would take a problem-oriented approach, starting from the kinds of problems R users face when working with LLMs, and then discussing resources and solutions. It will follow the [diataxis documentation framework's definition of "explanation"](https://diataxis.fr/explanation/) rather than "tutorial", "how-to", or "reference".

It will also discuss the ethics, for example, debated around model generation, environmental impact, and how to structure work to reduce cost and environmental impact.

This kind of resource is unlikely to be created via the traditional means of publishing a physical book, due to the speed of change in the LLMs/AI space at the moment.  Creating this as an online resource means that there is scope to quickly update content, as new technologies and ideas emerge.

## Detail

### Minimum Viable Product

An initial MVP would include the book repository, the chapter outlines with headings and subheading, and collated resources for each chapter.

As the approach to creating each chapter would be to create the aforementioned outline for each before adding additional context, it should be trivial to deliver such an MVP with minimal effort.

### Architecture

The project will be stored in a public repository on GitHub, using Quarto to create the book, and GitHub Actions to render it.

### Assumptions

One assumption is that changes in applications of LLMs won't change so rapidly that the book would need to be entirely rewritten in the near future.  However, I plan to mitigate this risk by keeping content focused on context and explanation over how-to guidance (which already exist).  For example, while available underlying models and their capabilities are likely to see many changes over time, deciding factors for choosing an appropriate model will see less change.
