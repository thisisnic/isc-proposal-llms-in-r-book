# Executive Summary

This proposal requests $24,080 USD to bootstrap a free, community-owned online book on LLMs in R. 
LLMs are a popular topic at the moment, and both the underlying technologies and tooling in the R ecosystem are moving quickly.  Reliable guidance exists, but is scattered across package documentation, vignettes, and blog posts. The book will consolidate best practices, key resources, and accessible explanations into a single structured resource.

Over 6 months (Dec 2025 to May 2026), the project will:

- Set up infrastructure (GitHub/Quarto repo, CI/CD, license, domain).
- Conduct a community survey to refine scope and priorities.
- Draft and publish at least ten substantive chapters on relevant topics.
- Publicly release a complete first draft.
- Establish an editorial board and governance model to support future contributions.

Success will be measured by delivery of milestones, publication of ≥10 chapters, ≥100 survey responses, published community contributions, a transition to community governance, and a functioning editorial board.

The outcome will be a living, sustainable resource that strengthens R's role in modern AI and leaves analysts, data scientists, and educators equipped to use LLMs effectively. After the funded phase, hosting is cost-free and governance will be community-led, ensuring long-term value without further ISC expense.
