# Executive Summary

This proposal requests $16,000 USD to bootstrap a free, community-owned online book on LLMs in R. R users face a fast-moving ecosystem where reliable guidance is scattered across package docs, package vignettes, and blog posts. The book will consolidate best practices, examples, and explanations into a single structured, accessible resource.

Over six months (Dec 2025 - May 2026), the project will:

- Set up infrastructure (GitHub/Quarto repo, CI/CD, license, domain).
- Conduct a community survey to refine scope and priorities.
- Draft and publish at least ten substantive chapters with reproducible code.
- Publicly release a complete first draft.
- Establish an editorial board and governance model to support future contributions.

Success will be measured by delivery of milestones, publication of ≥10 chapters, ≥50 survey responses, ≥3 merged community contributions, and a functioning editorial board.

The outcome will be a living, sustainable resource that strengthens R's role in modern AI and equips analysts, data scientists, and educators to use LLMs effectively. After the funded phase, hosting is cost-free and governance will be community-led, ensuring long-term value without further ISC expense.
