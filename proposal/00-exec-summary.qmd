# Executive Summary

This proposal requests $19,080 USD to bootstrap a free and open, community-owned online book on LLMs in R. 
LLMs are a popular topic at the moment, and both the underlying technologies and tooling in the R ecosystem are moving quickly. Reliable guidance exists, but is scattered across package documentation, vignettes, and blog posts. The book will consolidate best practices, key resources, and accessible explanations into a single structured resource.  The outcome will be a living, sustainable resource that strengthens R's role in modern AI and leaves analysts, data scientists, and educators equipped to use LLMs effectively. After the funded phase, hosting is cost-free and governance will be community-led, ensuring long-term value without further ISC expense.
