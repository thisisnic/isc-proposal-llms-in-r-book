# Project plan

## Start-up phase

### Administrative tasks

The project is already set up as a repository on GitHub the with appropriate license and initial GitHub Actions CI/CD enabled.  Remaining administrative tasks during start-up phase:
  
- purchase URL for the project which will point to the published book
- set up additional CI jobs to check for readability etc on new pull requests
- expand on first drafts of templates for content

### Content planning

In the start-up phase we plan to conduct a detailed review of available resources, and conduct a community survey to identify key topics of most importance to the wider R community.  We will use the outcome of this stage to refine the list of high-level topics and focuses.

## Technical delivery

Dec 31 2025 - Milestone 1 -  Foundation:
Community survey conducted and scope finalised. Infrastructure templates and contribution guidelines established. Domain registered and additional CI/CD.

Jan 31 2026 - Milestone 2 - Launch: 
Initial chapters published. Public launch and community outreach initiated.

Feb 28 2026 - Milestone 3 - Community Infrastructure:
Editorial governance established. Community contribution workflows operational. Additional content developed based on survey feedback.

Mar 31 2026 - Milestone 4 - Content Development: 
Substantial content expansion. Community contributions integrated. Infrastructure templates documented for reuse.

April 30 2026 - Milestone 5 - Complete Draft:
Comprehensive first version online. All core topics addressed per community survey.

May 30 2026 - Milestone 6 - Community Transition:
Editorial board fully operational. Governance model documented and transferred based on development phrase.

## Other aspects

We will publicise the work by posting about it on LinkedIn, Mastodon, and Bluesky upon realisation of each milestone, and actively encouraging community feedback.  We will also write content to be shared quarterly on the R Consortium blog to ensure wide reach, as well as posting on personal blogs and submitting the links to R Weekly, and submitting talks to major R conferences.

We also would like to note that LLMs will not be used to write the contents of this book - human understanding and engagement is key to writing materials which are genuinely useful to others.  Any use of LLMs will be for peripheral tasks such as ensuring conformance to defined principles (e.g. lack of use of jargon, readability), creating templates, and checking for grammar/spelling.

## Budget & funding plan

We would like to request financial support of $19,080 from the ISC to develop the book materials and transition the project to a community-owned resource. The labour costs use an hourly rate of $100, based on proposals for previous R Consortium sponsored projects.
