# Project plan

## Start-up phase

### Admininstrative tasks

I will complete the following administrative tasks:
- Creating the project repository on GitHub with appropriate license
- Setting up the project as a Quarto project which uses GitHub actions to publish the book to GitHub pages
- Purchasing URL for the project which will point to the published book

### Content planning

In the start-up phase I plan to conduct a detailed review of available resources, and conduct a community survey to identify key topics of most importance to the wider R community.  I will use the outcome of this stage to refine the list of high-level topics.

## Technical delivery

Dec 31 2025 - Milestone 1: Repo created, contribution guidelines created, scope and outline finalised based on community survey
Jan 31 2026 - Milestone 2: Introductory chapters published and initial publicity sought
Feb 28 2026 - Milestone 3: Major content release 1
Mar 31 2026 - Milestone 4: Major content release 2
April 30 2026 - Milestone 5: Full first draft release
May 30 2026 - Milestone 6: Editorial board established and transition to community governance

## Other aspects

The intention is to release the contents under a "Creative Commons Zero v1.0 Universal" license.  The project is to be stored on GitHub on a public repository.

I will publicise the work by posting about it on LinkedIn, Mastodon, and Bluesky upon realisation of each milestone, and actively encouraging community feedback.  I will also write content to be shared quarterly on the R Consortium blog to ensure wide reach.

While I intend to develop the initial contents myself, once a completed first draft is completed, I'll be opening it up to community contributions.  Clear templates and guidance will be established, and I'll solicit input from members of the community on how to best govern this.

I also intend to submit a talk to major R conferences like UseR! 2026 on the process of establishing the book and growing a community around it.  I am open to feedback on other relevant avenues too.

## Budget & funding plan

I would like to request financial support of 16000 USD from the ISC to develop the book materials, and transition the project to a community-owned resource.
