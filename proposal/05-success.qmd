# Success

## Definition of done

* Success means delivering a public, freely available book website on LLMs in R that includes a clear outline and scope of the book agreed through community input, a working CI/CD pipeline, an editorial board in place and contribution guidelines published.

## Measuring success

* Traffic to book webpage and number of contributors is steadily increasing.

## Future work

After the funded phase, the book can be extended by adding new chapters as R packages evolve or new methods emerge, translating the book into other languages to broaden reach, using the book as a base for workshops, tutorials, or course materials, and maintaining an open contribution model so the community can update, refine, and extend content long term.
