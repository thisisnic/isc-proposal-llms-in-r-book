# Success

## Definition of done

Success means delivering a public, freely available book website on LLMs in R that includes:

- A clear outline and scope of the book agreed through community input.
- At least 10 chapters published.
- Working CI/CD pipeline.
- An editorial board in place and contribution guidelines published.
- A governance model and roadmap documented, ensuring the project can continue after the initial period without further direct funding.

## Measuring success

Success could be measured in the following key areas:

1. Infrastructure delivery: reusable CI/CD templates deployed and documented; standardised contribution templates reviewed by community.
2. Content published: At least 10 complete chapters live online by April 2026.
3. Community engagement: Minimum of 100 survey responses; ≥3 community PRs merged by project end.
4. Governance established: Editorial board of at least 3 members active by May 2026, with review process tested.
5. Reach/visibility: Website traffic metrics and engagement on announcement posts; two R Consortium blog posts published and ≥1 conference submission made.
 
## Future work

After the funded phase, the book can be extended by:

- Adding new chapters as R packages evolve or new methods emerge.
- Translating the book into other languages to broaden reach.
- Using the book as a base for workshops, tutorials, or course materials.
- Maintaining an open contribution model so the community can update, refine, and extend content long term.
