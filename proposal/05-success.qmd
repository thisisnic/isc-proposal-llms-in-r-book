# Success

## Definition of done

Success means delivering a public, freely available book website on LLMs in R that includes:

- A clear outline and scope of the book agreed through community input.
- At least 10 substantive chapters covering introductory through intermediate use cases.
- Reproducible code examples and working CI/CD pipeline.
- An editorial board in place and contribution guidelines published.
- A governance model and roadmap documented, ensuring the project can continue after the initial period without further direct funding.

## Measuring success

Success could be measured in the following key areas:

1. Milestone completion: Each deliverable in the six-milestone plan achieved on schedule.
2. Content published: At least 10 complete chapters live online by April 2026.
3. Community engagement: Minimum of 50 survey responses; ≥3 community PRs merged by project end.
4. Governance established: Editorial board of at least 3 members active by May 2026, with review process tested.
5. Reach/visibility: Website traffic metrics and engagement on announcement posts; at least one R Consortium blog post published and ≥1 conference submission made.

## Future work

After the funded phase, the book can be extended by:

- Adding new chapters as R packages evolve or new methods emerge.
- Expanding into advanced topics such as agentic workflows, evaluation frameworks, and integration with other languages/tools.
- Translating key chapters into other languages to broaden reach.
- Using the book as a base for workshops, tutorials, or course materials.
- Maintaining an open contribution model so the community can update, refine, and extend content long term.
