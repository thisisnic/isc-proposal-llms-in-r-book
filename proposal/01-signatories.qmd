# Signatories
<!--
This section provides the ISC with a view of the support received from
the community for a proposal. Acceptance isn't predicated on
popularity but community acceptance is important. Willingness to
accept outside input is also a good marker for project delivery.

An optional section would be for R-Core signatories where changes to R
are proposed.

## Project team

Nic Crane is an open source maintainer and holds a PhD in Applied Social Statistics from Lancaster University.  Nic recently co-authored "Scaling Up with R and Apache Arrow", available online at <arrowrbook.com> and published by CRC Press in July 2025.  Nic has a passion for teaching, having taught "introduction to R workshops" to hundreds of learners earlier in their career while a consultant at Mango Solutions.  Nic also has previously developed an online course on package development for Data Camp, and delivered in-person workshops at Posit Conf in 2023 and 2024, with excellent learner feedback on the content and accessibility of course materials.  Nic's experience in authoring online R books, as well as developing educational materials makes them well-suited to complete this project.
