# The Problem

LLMs and AI are having a huge impact on software engineering and data science, and the tools available, model capabilities, and advice is rapidly changing.  Guidance on effective use of the available tools is scattered across difference locations, such as model vendor guidance, R package vignettes, and blog posts by community members.  

As a result, users must piece together knowledge from multiple sources, with no obvious place to start.  There is real risk of misapplying methods, and wasting time.  The problem exists for R users including data scientists, analysts, and educators who want to integrate LLMs into analysis, teaching, and tooling. 

This problem could be solved by consolidating best practices, examples, and guidance around tooling into a single structured resource.  This would give R users a reliable foundation for experimenting with LLMs and strengthen R's position as a platform for responsible, reproducible AI.

Due to the speed at which things are moving in LLMs/AI, it's unlikely that this kind of book would be a good candidate for a permanent, static reference like a book published via a traditional publisher.  Instead, the value lies in creating a living, community-oriented resource that can be updated as packages evolve, new methods emerge, and best practices shift. By structuring it as an open, ongoing work rather than a fixed text, the book can remain relevant to R users navigating a fast-changing landscape while avoiding the obsolescence that traditional publications in this domain are likely to face.
