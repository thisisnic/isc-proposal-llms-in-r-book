# The Problem

LLMs and AI are having a huge impact on software engineering and data science, and the tools available, model capabilities, and advice and guidance on their use are all rapidly changing.  Much of the avaialble guidance is scattered across difference locations, such as model vendor websites, R package vignettes, and blog posts by community members.  

Existing resources provide valuable solution-oriented information, such as how to use specific functions and packages, but R users are left without a clear framework for understanding the wider problem space. As a result, users must piece together knowledge from multiple sources, with no obvious place to start, risking misapplying methods and wasting time and effort. The problem exists for many R users including data scientists, analysts, and educators who want to integrate LLMs into analysis, teaching, and tooling. 

This problem could be solved by consolidating best practices, explanations, and guidance into a single structured resource, with further links to other resources, and clear structure for governance and community contribution. There is some existing work in this space, such as [Luis D. Verde Arregoitia's guide to tooling for LLMs in R](https://luisdva.github.io/llmsr-book/), but this focuses on available tools rather than concepts or context.

It's unlikely that this kind of resource would be a good candidate for a permanent, static reference like a book published via a traditional publisher, and value lies in creating a living, community-oriented resource that can be updated as packages evolve, new methods emerge, and best practices shift, so it can remain relevant.

This approach aligns with successful R Consortium-funded social infrastructure projects, including translation and internationalisation efforts that have strengthened community accessibility, and educational initiatives that have built lasting knowledge resources for the R ecosystem. Like these precedents, this project prioritises sustainable, community-owned infrastructure over static deliverables.
